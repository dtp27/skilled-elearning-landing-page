## Overview
This is my attempt at re-creating the skilled elearning landing page, as part of the Frontend Metnor challenge series. It is a simple one-page website that mimicks a generic e-learning website.

### Solution

- GitHub Repo: [Add solution URL here](https://github.com/dtp27/skilled-elearning-landing-page/)
- Live Site: [Add live site URL here](https://dtp27.github.io/skilled-elearning-landing-page/)

## My process
1. Structure all of my HTML 
2. Assign CSS variables to all of the styling
3. Start with Mobile layout, then move to Tablet then Desktop
4. For each layout, work my way from top to bottom

### Built with
- HTML/CSS
- Focused more on accessbility
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- BEM naming system.

### Challenges
1. Getting the images to behave the way I want was an immense challenge for me

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developers Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). MDN is always a reliable resource wehen it comes to Front-end Web Development.

- [Daniel Tonon's guide on How to Section Your HTML](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-section-your-html/#aa-dont-swap-div-for-a-section).  This was a massive help in how I designed the web page from a structural perspective.

- [BEM 101](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/). This was a great guide as this was my first project using the BEM naming system.
